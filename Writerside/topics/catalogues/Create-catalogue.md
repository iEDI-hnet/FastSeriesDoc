# Create Catalogue

## Before you start
Do you need products for your catalogs or can you simply make a catalog with text and images?

Using products for building catalogs has several advantages:

    - convenient management of product data and images
    - reuse same products in different catalogs and Showroom
    - automatic update of catalogs when products change

And the biggest benefit - quickly create multiple product pages and maintain them later with product updates.
