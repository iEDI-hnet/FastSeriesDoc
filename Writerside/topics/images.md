# Using Image manager
Advanced image upload, edit and bulk operations

Image Manager â€“ a central place to manage your images.
1. You can upload files by selecting from your computer.

2. After images are uploaded, you can edit, delete, crop, rotate, resize them in batch by selecting them. 

### Optimal image size
Depends on the proportion of page the image will take.  The full page is about 600px x 800px (or 800 x 600 in landscape). Therefore if your images will take not more than a quarter page (in any place you use them) than max size 400 x 300 is optimal and so on. Smaller images are better for performance, but too small size could lower quality. The only exception if you plan to use pdf format with images that require zoom (e.g. maps, charts) then you need a higher resolution (even larger than a page).
