## Functionality

The workflow of maintaining product master data is a tedious task that demands a lot of resources to gather data and images from vendors. FastProducts seeks to ease this task by using a built-in sharing service. Customers can invite their suppliers to add their catalogue data including images needed for the customers web-shop. When suppliers share a catalogue with their customers, items in this catalogue becomes available for sale within their availability from/to date. Customers can then compile a catalogue containing products the customer has selected from their suppliers catalogues. FastProducts can also be acquired by suppliers to create customer catalogues that are shared or sent by EDI to their customers.
