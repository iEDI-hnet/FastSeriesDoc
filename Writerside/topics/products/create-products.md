To create a new individual product follow the steps below.
1. Create a product
   Click the Create a Product button on Dashboard or  Products page.
2. Enter product information.
   Name and Number are required fields.

Number is a unique identifier of the product in your product database. You can use generated number or replace with your own number that you use in other systems.

You can select previously created images collections or upload new images from your computer.

Use the FastProducts app to create, edit or import your products and images then quickly add them to your catalogues.

Extend with custom fields / variants / options including images, prices, attachments, market description, specifications and more.

To avoid creating multiple products of the same type, to handle seasons, qualities, colors, sizetables or other attributes, you can instead use Variants tab.
