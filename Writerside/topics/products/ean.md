# EAN/UPC

A EAN/UPC code is a unique identifier for a product. The same code is used worldwide. Printing it as a stripped barcode on a product makes it easy to identify the product with a barcode reader. The stripes in the barcode represent a number, the actual EAN/UPC code, that is often also printed under the barcode. 

Use the EAN/UPC list to locate products to check if they have a common identification.
